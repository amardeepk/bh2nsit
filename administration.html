A total of four hostel buildings (BH1, BH2, BH3, BH4) are present for male students, one for each year. There are two girls’ hostels (GH). Each hostel is well maintained with staff working overtime to ensure that students live comfortably inside the building premises. The hostel buildings are located close to the canteens as well as the administrative block (where classes ensue). Mess food is nutritious with a different menu for each day of the week.">

The hostel life of a student has the cabability to transform him into a self-sufficient and independent human being, along with cultivating a sense of socialism and helping him understand the practicalities of life. It shall not be wrong to state that the life that one spends here transforms and enriches him. History has proven the diverse plethora of career paths that this hostel has led students to opt for with some students cracking the civil services or others bieng sucessful engineers, scientists or researchers. The atmosphere in this hostel and our campus is one of the most enriched, safe and promotes creativity. To ensure this, and that our students do not face difficulties the warden, caretaker and other staff make constant efforts towards maintaining and servicing the needs of the students. I can gladly say that Student Welfare of the Institute are making very solemn efforts to provide a good campus life to the students. Rules and regulations provided by the hostel are the guidelines to enjoy a very peaceful hostel life and thus I appeal to all the students to abide by these Rules and Regulations of Boys Hostel-2. The student committees ensure that the general residents message timely reach the wardens office and are motivated to get any issues solved. There must be healthy atmosphere on the campus where students have a friendly interaction with each otherís and help the administration. To overcome any such barrier, Students can use this portal to interact with the hostel adminstration from time to timeby using the Hostels website. I extend my heartiliest welcome to the new entrants and wish them a Happy and Healthy campus life.<br>
I am sure , you will enjoy your stay even in the transit campus and become responsible and enlightened citizens of India with capability to face and resolve all types of challenges in the greater interest of society and the country as a whole.
